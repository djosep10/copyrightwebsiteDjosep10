	This topic has always interested me, especially learning what is considered a stream and how apps like Spotify have not conformed and found loopholes that makes artist loose interest and pull their music from their platforms. This topic is doable because there have been many examples who did not or do not have their music on Spotify or other streaming music services because of how they count a stream. There is a lot of technical data that I can compare with figures charts and graphs that makes my webpage pop. 
	I can also add a stream calculator to show how many streams it would take for an artist to go bronze, silver, gold and platinum. The target audience is everyone who enjoys music, I feel that the rap industry makes a big deal out of what streaming does to their brands, when in reality it affects everyone. It ranges from country music to KPOP. The Color scheme is going to be something a little more gloomy, I’m thinking black background with blue accents around the page, white accents, and for the other pages, I’ll add some complementary colors to provide and accentuate the gloominess of the topic. The challenges that I would have would be in the design phase of the project. The information needed to provide an adequate education on what’s going on would take about 3 days as opposed to the 3 weeks building the actual site. Another challenge would be accessibility, with my concept I feel that the colors I choose must be perfect for everyone. I would need to learn more about design layouts in order to complete this assignment with the best of my ability. Given enough time, I can put out the product I feel is the best.
